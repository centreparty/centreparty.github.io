Animal Welfare
==============

There are people who argue that all meat eating is evil and so any
attempts to improve the welfare of farm animals is pointless.

It is true that the 5% of the UK population that are vegetarians do
not harm animal welfare at all, however the other 95% of people do not
want to do that.

It is not realistic to expect this to change any time soon. Even
a massive campaign that doubles the amount of vegetarians would leave
90% of the UK population as meat eaters.

However, before they are eaten, we should give animals the highest
welfare we can, they should have a chance to roam freely outdoors and
have as natural as experience as possible.

Britain currently has some of the highest animal welfare standards in
the world. However, we can do much better.

Until now we have been in a perverse situation, every time we
unilaterally increase standards, we make our farmers less competitive,
and increase the amount of imports we take and so increase the number
of farm animals who live in poor conditions.

After Brexit, Agricultural policy is decided by the UK
government. Industry lobbies notwithstanding and whatever we agree to
in new trade agreements, there far less stopping us from insisting all
imports must meet our own domestic standards.

This area of full of problematic questions, including

* How free does 'free range' need to be?
* How organic should 'organic' food be?
* How should animals be killed?
* How should animals be transported?
* How is animal welfare balanced against environmental concerns?
* How is animal welfare balanced against the consumer cost of food? 
* Who pays for conversion to higher standards?
* Who monitors the standards?
* Who is responsible for certifying the standards of imports? 


This is not something that can become perfect overnight, but by
setting the direction of travel and providing suitable incentives and
conversion funding, industry and society can adapt.

To take one example, mandatory Free Range Eggs - this is a relatively
quick win as half of eggs produced are already free-range. Most
consumers already buy free-ranged eggs when they go to the shop.

Most of the battery eggs are used by restaurants and the catering
industry. The increase in cost is fairly small, and you can still get
economies of scale while increasing animal welfare.
