UK Senate
=========

Regional chamber
----------------

The House of Lords has an archaic charm but is not fit for the modern
era, especially after Brexit when the non-democratic nature of the
Lords is further exposed. It doesn't make sense to bring back control
from an unelected European Commission to give it to an unelected
Lords.

One of the advantages of the American model of a Senate is that it
provides a regional balance.

This is especially important in the UK where governance is extremely
titled towards London. There are lots of indirect forms of
representation and implicit biases that London enjoys.

There are 100 or so historic counties in the UK, that is far too
many. The US Senate has 100 members but it also has 5 times the
population.

One thing we can keep from our EU days are the regional
constituencies.

2 senators per region plus 1 senator for overseas territories and
expats gives 25 senators which is a workable number. An odd number is
good to prevent tied votes.

Each term can be six years with staggered elections so that each
region re-elects a senator every three years, apart from the overseas
region which just elects its sole senator every four years.

This means that every May 1st, around four Senators will be elected
(perhaps a couple more if Senators die or resign in the preceding
year).

    A small set of Senatorial elections every year would be like a
    heart beat. Would that lead to more responsive democracy, or with
    the political class constantly on edge, would nothing get done?
    
    Should a block of Senatorial elections instead be every two years
    like in the US?

As in the US Senate, the senator with the longest tenure in each
region is known as the "senior senator"; the other is the "junior
senator".

The Senate should be based somewhere else than London; such as
Birmingham or Manchester.

If the Senate is too powerful it will completely up-end our
constitution. This system prevents that because the regions are not
trying to have an equal population. This gives the House of Commons
more democratic legitimacy and thus primacy over the Senate when
deadlocked.

Transition
----------

In the current House of Lords, the government appoints people with the
expertise required and the Lords staff each other.

Meanwhile, each US Senator controls a platoon of staffers, lawyers,
case workers and experts.

Getting from one system to the other may need a little time.

Only the "Lord Senators" would be allowed to vote or block House of
Commons legislation.

However, the most active and knowledge Lords could be converted into
advisers or kept engaged in some other way.

How to pay for the policy
-------------------------

This policy can be delivered using existing budgets.

According to the `Electoral Reform Society`_, "The net operating costs of
the House of Lords in 2013-4 were £93.1m".

Once the appointed Lords are removed, there is plenty of money there
for the Senator's staff. Even if you keep a third of the budget back
for a central pool of lawyers and other Senate staff, that is still a
very generous £2.5 million to pay for each Senator's salary, staff and
other expenses.

Not included in any of the above figures is building costs, and a new
build Senate in Birmingham or Manchester will be far cheaper to
maintain than the existing collapsing palace in the centre of London.

If the old chamber is kept, it can be converted into additional select
committee chambers for the Commons or used for some other purpose.
