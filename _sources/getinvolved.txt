Get Involved
============

We need help! Lots and lots of it.

We need improvements to the existing pages and we need a lot of new
policy ideas too.

Collaboration should primarily be through the Github project found at:

https://github.com/centreparty/centreparty

To write an issue, use:

https://github.com/centreparty/centreparty/issues

For those who are technical, feel free to make pull requests directly
to the project.
